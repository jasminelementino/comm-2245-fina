<p><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p>You can contact me via my email: @lementinoj@unm.edu </p>
<p>Contacting me through this email can be for constructive criticism, suggestions, or ways of improving any of my work. The suggestions will not be taken in any way as rude (if they are professional) but as a way to clean up any edges I may have missed. I definitely want to improve my design skills and my way of branding myself. This can be design improvements on this website, or any of the links in my portfolio: &ldquo;Introductory Webpage&rdquo;, &ldquo;Creating a Header using CSS&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Inserting and Formatting Images.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you. <br>
