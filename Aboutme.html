<p>About Me</p>
<p>It is easy to become fixated on a person&rsquo;s educational goals and accomplishments. After all, it is what someone dedicates most of their time and energy into throughout the entirety of their lives. I am proud of my academic and career accomplishments and although I am proud enough to proclaim them when someone asks about the person I am, I can&rsquo;t help but think sometimes is it just enough to include what I like to do during my personal time? </p>
<p>I love doing puzzles. It is a small hobby, but not one that I have carried into my adulthood as much as I would like. Mostly because I don&rsquo;t know what I would do with them upon completing them, I could glue them and seal them in stone forever, but I have no designated space for them. </p>
<p>I also love baking. The cold seasons go hand in hand with baking, so I enjoy that time of year as well. I find it so enjoyable to find new recipes, decorations for completed recipes and ways of presenting the finished products to deliver to friends and family. As much as I enjoy baking, I don&rsquo;t have a sweet tooth. Making something that took a lot of time and energy and giving them to the people I love is more gratifying than a sweet treat to me. </p>
<p>Small hobbies that I do on the side are what make me a well-rounded person to accomplish my academic and career goals. I think these deserve more notability in introduction. </p>
