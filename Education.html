<p><strong>Education </strong></p>
<p>When I think of my education I think of my most recent years, i.e., high school and early years of college. I never think of the earlier years that contributed to my progress than I was able to achieve later on. </p>
<p>In elementary school I didn&rsquo;t care much about school. Although the memories are fond, I remember that I would never be as excited about the lessons as I was about the activities that the lessons entailed or activities we were rewarded with in between lessons. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to tests and filled in the answer bubbles as if it were a game. However, I made friends during these crucial years of life that would be a great influence on me for the rest of my life regarding my education. </p>
<p>Middle school is the least rememberable part of my life. But, I will always have gratitude towards my eighth-grade self for deciding to enroll in a dual credit program for my high school years. If it weren&rsquo;t for her (she didn&rsquo;t think that she could do it in the first place and was very hesitant) I would not have accomplished what I have. </p>
<p>In high school, after much crucial development, I finally began to take school seriously. Because I took dual enrollment classes throughout the entirety of high school I was able to graduate with two associate degrees which gave me a head start in my career and in college. </p>
<p><strong>To put it shortly</strong>, my most notable educational accomplishment thus far is graduating with an associate degree in general studies and liberal arts. My goal is to graduate with a BA in political science and communication with a minor in psychology. </p>
